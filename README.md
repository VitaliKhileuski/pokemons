- public folder  

this folder contains file that set some properties to our web page like manifest.json.
it also contains logos for our site and a html file that is the entry point of our program.

src folder contains main script index.js and two folders like components and services. Components is used for the web architecture, where all components are independent. We have only one file which hepls me to work with PokeApi in services.
